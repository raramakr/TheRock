# Adding tests to TheRock

## Test Flow

After TheRock builds its artifacts, we test those artifacts through [`test_artifacts.yml`](../../.github/workflows/test_artifacts.yml). The testing flow works as:

```mermaid
graph LR
    test_sanity_check --> configure_test_matrix --> test_components
```

where we:

1. Check that the artifacts pass sanity tests.
1. The `configure_test_matrix` step runs [`fetch_test_configurations.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/fetch_test_configurations.py), where we generate a test matrix for which tests to run.
1. After we generate the matrix, `test_components` executes those tests in parallel.

### How these tests are executed

These tests are retrieved from [`fetch_test_configurations.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/fetch_test_configurations.py), where we generate a matrix of tests to run for various AMD GPU families from [`amdgpu_family_matrix.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/amdgpu_family_matrix.py) on both Linux and Windows test machines.

These tests are run per pull request, main branch commit, `workflow_dispatch` and nightly runs.

### What kind of tests are suitable for TheRock

Since TheRock is the open source build system for HIP and ROCm, we are interested in tests for individual subprojects as well as tests that exercise multiple subprojects, especially for build and runtime dependencies. We also perform higher level testing of overall user-facing behavior and downstream frameworks like PyTorch.

## Adding tests

To add tests, add your executable logic to `github_actions/test_executable_scripts` with a Python file (in order to be compatible with Linux and Windows). Below is an example for [`hipblaslt.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/test_executable_scripts/test_hipblaslt.py):

```python
cmd = [f"{THEROCK_BIN_DIR}/hipblaslt-test", "--gtest_filter=*pre_checkin*"]
logging.info(f"++ Exec [{THEROCK_DIR}]$ {shlex.join(cmd)}")
subprocess.run(
    cmd,
    cwd=THEROCK_DIR,
    check=True,
)
```

After creating your script, please refer below to create your test entry in [`fetch_test_configurations.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/fetch_test_configurations.py)

## Fields for the test matrix

Add an entry in [`test_matrix`](../../build_tools/github_actions/fetch_test_configurations.py), then your test will be enabled in the test workflow

In [`fetch_test_configurations.py`](../../build_tools/github_actions/fetch_test_configurations.py), a test option (in this example rocBLAS) in `test_matrix` is setup as:

```
"rocblas": {
    "job_name": "rocblas",
    "fetch_artifact_args": "--blas --tests",
    "timeout_minutes": 5,
    "test_script": f"python {SCRIPT_DIR / 'test_rocblas.py'}",
    "platform": ["linux", "windows"],
}
```

| job_name            | string | Name of the job                                                                                                                    |
| fetch_artifact_args | string | Arguments for which artifacts for [`install_rocm_from_artifacts.py`](../../build_tools/install_rocm_from_artifacts.py) to retrieve |
| timeout_minutes     | int    | The timeout (in minutes) for the test step                                                                                         |
| test_script         | string | The path to the test script                                                                                                        |
| platform            | array  | An array of platforms that the test can execute on, options are `linux` and `windows`                                              |

> [!NOTE]
> When adding a new component to TheRock (typically a new .toml file), you may need to update `install_rocm_from_artifacts.py` to allow CI workflows and users to selectively install it.<br>
> Adding libraries to existing components requires no script changes.<br>
> See the [Adding Support for New Components](./installing_artifacts.md#adding-support-for-new-components) guide for step-by-step instructions.
